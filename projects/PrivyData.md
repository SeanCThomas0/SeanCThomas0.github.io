# PrivyData

PrivyData is a web application designed to analyze student data while ensuring the privacy of individual records through differential privacy techniques. Differential privacy offers rigorous privacy guarantees, allowing data analysis without compromising individual confidentiality. The OpenDP library is integral to implementing these privacy-preserving measures.

## Overview

This project ensures the privacy of individual records while providing insights from student data.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python, used to create RESTful APIs for managing data queries and interactions within the application.
- **SQLite**: Employed as the database engine to store student records in a lightweight, relational database.
- **Python**: Serves as the primary programming language for backend logic and data processing.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations and statistical computations, such as calculating means and standard deviations.
- **Nginx**: Used as a web server and reverse proxy to handle HTTP requests efficiently and securely.
- **Ansible**: Automates deployment and configuration management, ensuring consistency across environments.
- **Travis CI**: Provides continuous integration services to automate testing and deployment processes.
